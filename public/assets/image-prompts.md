## RECOMMENDED AI TOOLS

1. **Midjourney v6** - Best for photorealistic, artistic shots
2. **DALL-E 3** - Good for consistent style, product photography
3. **Stable Diffusion XL** - Best for screenshots, UI images
4. **Leonardo.ai** - Good for product photography style

## GENERATION TIPS

- Add `--ar 16:9` or appropriate ratio to Midjourney prompts
- For hyper-realism add: `8K, RAW photo, ultra detailed, photorealistic`
- For dark moody shots add: `dramatic lighting, dark background, rim lighting`
- For clean product shots add: `studio photography, product photography, white background`
